It's not 100% identical and there are rooms for improvment. Mostly background colors are changed and everything else is Joplin's default UI and your system default font.

This theme is a modified version of [Joplin Light Theme](https://github.com/LongBay/Joplin-Light-Theme) by [LongBay](https://github.com/LongBay) originally [Joplin Clear UI theme](https://github.com/marcteys/joplin-theme-clearUI) by [Marc Teyssier](https://github.com/marcteys).
